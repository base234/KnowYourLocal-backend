Here we are building a project where a person can create a event and chat with it. Using the Foursquare API, OpenAI and Firecrawl, we are trying to build a comprehensive application that works with AI-powered features, includes a local assistant that serves event planners, newcomers and residents with intelligent neighborhood navigation, venue discovery and local business integration using Foursquare Places API + FireCrawl.
